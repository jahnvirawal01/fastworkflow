# fastworkflow

# Problems

## 1. The fastworkflow application has a recurring issue where certain commands, such as @help_about, cause the system to crash with an exception (e.g., "Exception in thread Thread-6"). Additionally, commands like @help often return ambiguous responses asking for prefixes, even when valid commands are entered. This inconsistent behavior disrupts workflow execution and makes debugging difficult.
